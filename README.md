<a href="https://queenvicki.github.io/Project_1/"> <h1>GlobalBuddy Exchange </h1> <a>

GlobalBuddy Exchange is a business idea that was created after disuccsion with another college student in WAES on my course, after my trip to Korea about being able to buy things from Korea that aren'rt in the UK so the idea for this site. The website allows:

1. Friends to trade cultural experiences in other countries all over the world such as South Korea.
2. The business to facilitate genuine connection and keep it's GBE community safe so people who would like to experience a new connection can do so from a trusted middleman.
3. An alternative to trading cultures in a new way.

This project was created using: HTML, CSS.

<h2> Final Notes</h2>
- A few issues noted on the pages to fix at a later date such as (About us page formatting)
- With more time the about us page would have developed to have images breaking up each layer
- With more time the contact us page would have looked more appealing with a GIF or more designed background page. 
- More information on countried that are involved and how people can connect to a buddy.
